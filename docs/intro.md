# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This open-source textbook is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to the concepts, technologies, and practices involved in creating physical AI systems and humanoid robots.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is organized into modules that build upon each other, taking you from fundamental concepts to advanced implementations. Each module is designed to be self-contained while contributing to the overall understanding of physical AI and humanoid robotics.

### Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Graduate and undergraduate students in Computer Science and Engineering
- Researchers interested in physical AI and robotics
- Engineers working on robotic systems
- Anyone curious about the intersection of AI and physical systems

### Prerequisites

Before diving into this textbook, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental computer science concepts
- Some familiarity with mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)

## Module Overview

This textbook is organized into several key modules:

1. **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Introduction to ROS 2 as middleware for physical AI systems
2. **Module 2: Physical AI and Humanoid Control** - Physical AI foundations and humanoid robot control systems
3. **Module 3: Perception and Sensing Systems** - How robots perceive and interact with their environment
4. **Module 4: Locomotion and Mobility** - Locomotion principles and mobility systems for humanoid robots

## Learning Approach

Each module follows a consistent structure:
- Theoretical foundations
- Practical implementations
- Real-world examples
- Hands-on exercises
- Assessment opportunities

## Open Source

This textbook is completely open source under the CC BY-NC-SA license. We encourage contributions, corrections, and improvements from the community.

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish a foundation in ROS 2, the middleware that enables communication and coordination in robotic systems. This will prepare you for the more advanced topics in subsequent modules.
