# Module 2: Physical AI and Humanoid Control Systems

## Introduction: From Digital Intelligence to Embodied Cognition

The transition from digital AI to Physical AI represents a fundamental shift in how we conceptualize artificial intelligence. While traditional AI systems process information in virtual environments, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of real-world physics, sensorimotor integration, and embodied cognition. This module explores the control systems that enable humanoid robots to interact with their environment through purposeful physical action.

In biological systems, the nervous system (covered in Module 1) provides the communication infrastructure, but the motor system executes the physical actions. Similarly, in humanoid robotics, control systems translate high-level goals into precise motor commands that drive actuators and enable movement. This "muscular system" of the robot requires sophisticated algorithms that account for dynamics, balance, and environmental interaction.
