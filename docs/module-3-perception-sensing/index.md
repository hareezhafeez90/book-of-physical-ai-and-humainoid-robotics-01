# Module 3: Perception and Sensing Systems

## Introduction: The Robotic Senses

Perception and sensing systems form the "sensory organs" of humanoid robots, enabling them to understand and interact with their environment. Just as biological systems rely on vision, touch, hearing, and proprioception, humanoid robots require sophisticated sensor arrays and processing algorithms to navigate, manipulate objects, and interact safely with humans and environments.

This module explores the various sensing modalities used in humanoid robotics, from basic proprioceptive sensors that provide internal state information to advanced exteroceptive sensors that perceive the external world. We'll examine how these sensors work, their integration into robotic systems, and the algorithms that transform raw sensor data into actionable information.
