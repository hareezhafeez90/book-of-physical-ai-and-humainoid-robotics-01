# Module 4: Locomotion and Mobility

## Introduction: The Art of Humanoid Movement

Locomotion and mobility represent the culmination of all previous modules, where perception, control, and physical intelligence combine to enable humanoid robots to move through their environment with human-like agility and adaptability. This module explores the complex biomechanics, control strategies, and planning algorithms that enable humanoid robots to walk, run, climb, and navigate diverse terrains while maintaining balance and stability.

Humanoid locomotion is fundamentally different from wheeled or tracked robots due to the bipedal nature of human-like robots. The challenges include maintaining balance on two points of contact, adapting to uneven terrain, and achieving efficient, human-like movement patterns that are both stable and energy-efficient.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the biomechanics of human and humanoid locomotion
- Learn dynamic walking and balance control strategies
- Explore gait generation and adaptation algorithms
- Understand terrain adaptation and obstacle navigation
- Implement basic locomotion control algorithms
- Learn about energy efficiency in humanoid locomotion

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of ROS 2 concepts (Module 1)
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of humanoid control systems (Module 2)
- Knowledge of perception and sensing (Module 3)
